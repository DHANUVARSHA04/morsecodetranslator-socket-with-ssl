# morsecodetranslator-with-ssl
Morse Code Translator with Socket Programming, GUI, and OpenSSL

Hello! This project was completed by myself and my teammate, @BhavikaPradeep(https://github.com/BhavikaPradeep), during our 4th semester for the Computer Networking project. This code allows for running on multiple clients or localhost, and it requires Python 3.12.2 and OpenSSL to be installed.

Requirements:
Python 3.12.2
OpenSSL

How to Run:
Generate the certificate and key. In this code, the client checks the authorization of the certificate. 
Ensure that the certificate is trusted by Windows.
Open a command prompt and run the server file first.
Open a new command prompt and run the client file next.

Features:
Converts English to Morse code and vice versa.
Displays in the server terminal what client is requesting.

Compatibility:
This code is tested and works on Windows localhost and Windows multiple clients.
Note: Ensure the certificate is available on all devices when running with multiple clients.

Additional Files:
The repository includes both a presentation and a Word file documenting the project.
